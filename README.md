Take-Home Challenge Template
==============================

This is a template to be used for data science take home challenges.

Project Organization
------------

    ├── README.md          <- The top-level README for developers using this project.
    ├── data               <- Scripts to clean data
    │   ├── interim        <- Intermediate data that has been transformed.
    │   ├── processed      <- The final, canonical data sets for modeling.
    │   └── raw            <- The original, immutable data dump.
    │
    ├── models             <- Trained and serialized models, model predictions, or model summaries
    │
    ├── notebooks          <- Jupyter notebooks. Naming convention is a number (for ordering),
    │                         the creator's initials, and a short `-` delimited description, e.g.
    │                         `1.0-jqp-initial-data-exploration`.
    │
    ├── references         <- Data dictionaries, manuals, and all other explanatory materials.
    │
    ├── reports            <- Generated analysis as HTML, PDF, LaTeX, etc.
    │   └── figures        <- Generated graphics and figures to be used in reporting
    │
    |__ requirements.txt   <- The requirements file for reproducing the analysis environment, e.g.
                              generated with `pip freeze > requirements.txt`
